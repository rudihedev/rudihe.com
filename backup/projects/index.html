            This project is funded by Ministry of Higher Education Indonesia
            under the BIMA Fundamental Grant scheme. The purpose is to optimize
            the algorithm for detecting low resolution face images under various
            situation and conditions to provide robust and accurate detection of
            face images surrounded any national vital objects.

            The power is in a teamwork. Nobody can be a hero by himself, solo is
            not a good idea this time. Ability to convey idea, to digest peer
            opinions, to execute elegantly is the key to finalize this project
            smoothly and functionally. UI/US design, testing, monorepo, cloud
            infrastructure, frontend and backend skills are pushed upto
            unlimited limit.

            Tailoring frontend and backend is the key purpose of this project.
            Starting from project management and development, software
            architecture and UI/UX designing. Complex client state management
            carefully needs to handle, frontend and backend auth implementation,
            security issues. Full stack app framework is fully equipped for this
            project.

            Backend is get rocked. Sweet and smooth UI without any
            functionalities is nothing. Man behind the screen, a forgotten hero
            is now taking its roles. JavaScript is the engine to orchestrate all
            elements that connect database, query by SQL or even NoSQL,
            PostgreSQL, and database ORM with Prisma. Docker is always there to
            home everything along with deployment process.

            React as one of the most popular and easy-to-use frontend libraries
            is extensively employed for the project. The capabilities of React
            handling JavaScript modules, runtime, styling, hooks, state, data
            fetching, data validation, routing, CSR and package management is
            greatly utilized. TypeScript is also used to make programming life
            easier.

            This research proposes a new method for characterizing subsurface
            defects in high temperature wall by means of passive thermography.
            The method enables a fast and reliable quantitative defect
            characterization. Ten informative parameters have been proposed for
            this purpose based on temperature behavior on the outer surface wall
            of a petrochemical boiler. Multilayer perceptron neural network has
            been trained to characterize quantitatively three defect properties:
            thickness, length, and width of the defect. From an extensive
            testing of the method, it has been shown that the method is able to
            characterize the defect properties, which actually we believe is a
            new approach in passive thermography application.
